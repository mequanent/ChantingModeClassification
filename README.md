# Zema Dataset 
**This is a repository of our new dataset.**
Since the report for the dataset preparation and our computational analysis works are more than a single conference paper, we partitioned our work so far into the following two conferences.

* Mequanent Argaw Muluneh, Yan-Tsung Peng, Li Su. **Computational Analysis of Yaredawi YeZema Silt in Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church Chants**, The 25th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (**ISMIR 2024**), San Francisco, California, USA

* Mequanent Argaw Muluneh, Yan-Tsung Peng, Worku Abebe Degife, Nigussie Abate Tadesse, Aknachew Mebreku Demeku, Li Su. **Zema Dataset: A Comprehensive Study of Yaredawi Zema with a Focus on Horologium Chants**, The 6th International Conference on Information and Communication Technology for Development for Africa (**ICT4DA 2024**), Bahir Dar, Ethiopia
 

**About Supplementary Matrials:**
* We presented three audios, one for each chanting mode. We titled them according to their mode. 
* We also attached a corresponding text in photo, taken from the book of the chants.
